# gepy
Geometric computations in Python, using SageMath. Supports connections on Riemannian and Hermitian manifolds:
- Levi-Civita connection
- Gauduchon connections (for any t), e.g.
  - `t=-1` Bismut connection
  - `t=0` first canonical connection
  - `t=1` Chern connection

Additionally, the Riemann curvature, Ricci curvature, scalar curvature, sectional curvature, and torsion are implemented.
